This openfoam case uses the overInterDyMFoam solver
In this case a geometry change/"growth" is tried to achieve using the laplacianVelocity motionSolver, 
however after a few timesteps the defined patches start to deform/buckle in on itself.

This test case is not meant for any specific result, only to show the surface buckling
